## 🔍 Key Insights & Findings

### 🕒 Time-Based Insights

Evening hours contribute nearly 50% of total quantity sold, making it the most critical time slot

July is the peak demand month, while September and October show a noticeable dip

Fridays record the highest order volume, indicating strong weekend demand

### 🍕 Product Performance

Large pizzas generate the highest revenue, followed by Medium sizes

Classic category is the top seller with ~15K pizzas sold

Chicken category performs well in revenue, despite lower volume than Classic

### 🏆 Top & Bottom Performers

Top Pizza by Orders: The Classic Deluxe Pizza

Highest Revenue Pizza: The Barbecue Chicken Pizza

Lowest Order Volume: The Brie Carre Pizza

This contrast highlights that high revenue does not always mean high order volume, emphasizing pricing and size impact.
